Create custom keyboard with only allowed chars.

allow lowercase (unless custom keyboard works)
don’t move view up if it’s already up

Persistence: remember last color\*
Core Data: history of checked colors

LATER:
add screenshot button with black and white text
random color generator
redo slider buttons
make brightness max while app is open
add brightness slider
[?] Change hex text as sliders slide upon launch
Remove colored background to the right of slider thumbs (upon launch)
