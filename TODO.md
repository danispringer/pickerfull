###### App Store Description
• Are you a designer looking to share your colors with your customers?
• Are you a consumer looking to share your colors with your designer?

You, meet ColorFull. It lets you:

• Generate your perfect color from millions of combinations, using 3 sliders, or 3 spinners for max precision - in either HEX or RGB values.

• Paste a HEX or RGB code, preview, edit, and share it as a custom screenshot.

• Save, copy, or share your color, as an image (which includes the color and both HEX and RGB values) or as plain text (in either HEX or RGB values).

• Use it in either light or dark mode.

• Battery died? Your last selected color will automatically display when you launch the app again. ColorFull has got your back - and favorite color!

• Create random colors by tapping on the top left search icon or by asking Siri (app supports Siri Shortcuts, so you can create a voice command to have Siri open the app with a new color ready for you. Make sure you create at least one random color in the app itself using the top left search icon before setting up Siri Shortcuts, then open Settings > Siri & Search > All Shortcuts > Get random color).
