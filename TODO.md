redo launchscreen with app icon
\*launch with random color everytime
CP: Multiple dragging, add brightness slider
redo slider buttons
add share button
add screenshot button with black and white text
random color generator, allow lowercase (unless custom keyboard works), don’t move view up if it’s already up
