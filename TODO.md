###### Developer notes (feel free to peek)

EARLIER:

Move tutorial to separate view
Maybe fixed buttons/label instead of textfield so view never goes up and user sees sliders adjust, "hide/show" fake keyboard with button
Add “toggle controls” to toolbar options (with: share, save, take screenshot, toggle keyboard, gallery, more?)
add screenshot button with black and white text

add share button

replace lowercase with uppercase, unless you can force uppercase
don’t move view up if it’s already up (unless using fixed buttons)

Persistence: remember last color\*
Core Data: history of checked colors

LATER:

Crazy mode
Change slider values by tilting (only if optional)
random color generator
redo slider buttons
make brightness max while app is open
add brightness slider
[?] Change hex text as sliders slide upon launch
Remove colored background to the right of slider thumbs (upon launch)
support all orientations
size classes
rgb
hide status bar etc. make as clean and immersive as it can be.
persistence
