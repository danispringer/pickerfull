###### App Store Description
• Looking to create your perfect color real fast? This app is for you.
• ColorFull lets you intuitively generate your perfect color from millions of combinations, using just 3 sliders, or 3 spinners in either HEX or RGB values for max precision.
• ColorFull lets you also directly paste a HEX or RGB code so you can instantly preview, edit, and share it as a customized screenshot (simply tap on the share icon on the top right, then choose 'Paste text' to paste, preview and edit the pasted color, then tap on 'Share' and 'Share as image' to create a customized screenshot with your newly created color).
• ColorFull lets you easily save, copy, or share your color, both as an image which includes the color and both HEX and RGB values, or as plain text, both as HEX or RGB values.
• Battery died? No worries. Your last selected color will automatically display when you launch the app again. ColorFull has got your back - and favorite color!
• Create a random color anytime you'd like by tapping on the Search icon on the top left, or by asking Siri. ColorFull supports Siri Shortcuts, so you can create a voice command to have Siri open the app with a new color ready for you. Make sure you create at least one random color in the app itself using the search icon on the top left before trying to set up Siri Shortcuts, then open Settings > Siri & Search > All Shortcuts > Get random color, and record your custom phrase.
