# Color Picker
- Lets you combine the additive primary colours to create millions of combinations, using sliders.
- Lets you copy the generated HEX code to save your gorgeous blend.
- Lets you type a HEX code to preview the resulting colour.
- Sliders reposition themselves in real time, as soon as you type 6 characters, and the generated HEX code updates in real time as well, as soon as you move any slider.
