# Color Picker
- Combine the additive primary colours to create millions of combinations and save the result in hex code.
- Change sliders position and edit the generated code to update the resulting color, with the sliders position and generated code updating in real time.â€©
- **Note:** GIFs below are slower than the app's real-time performance (do you know why? ðŸ¤”).
