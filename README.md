# ColorFull (iOS)
Create amazing colors. Share with friends. Done.

\*ColorFull now supports iOS 13's new dark mode!


Hello,

* Meet ColorFull, a simple yet powerful app that lets you easily and precisely create and share your colors - or find your next favorite one – with the tap of a button or using Siri.

* Generate your perfect color from millions of combinations using 3 sliders – or 3 spinners for max precision.

* Paste (import) a color to immediately preview, edit, and share it.

* Save (export) your color by copying or sharing it.

* All actions (paste, copy, edit, and share) support both HEX and RGB values as text, and the copying and sharing actions support exporting the color as an image.

* Generate beautiful images which include the color and its HEX and RGB values with the tap of a button.

* Battery died? Your last selected color will automatically display when you launch the app again. ColorFull has got your back – and favorite color!

* Create gorgeous new colors with the tap of a button or using Siri.


* Ask us anything: ***REMOVED***

* Enjoying ColorFull? Please consider leaving a 5-star review. It would mean the world to us!
