# ColorFull (iOS)
We believe life should be ColorFull. Do you?

• Meet ColorFull, a simple yet "PowerFull" app that lets you easily and precisely create and share your colors - or find your next favorite one – with the tap of a button or using Siri.

• Export in HEX, RGB, or..

• Generate beautiful images (which include the color's HEX and RGB values, and of course the color itself) with just a tap

• Battery died? No worries. Your last selected color will automatically display when you launch the app again. ColorFull has got your back – and favorite color!


• Ask us anything: ***REMOVED***
